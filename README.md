Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. The winner is determined according to a set of rules. 
When the program is run, ask the user to pick an option between "R", "P" or "S"
"R" for "rock", 
"P" for "paper", 
"S" for "scissors".
Using the `choice` function from the inbuilt Python `random` module to make a choice for CPU player(computer).
It goes on to print both player's moves in the format: `Player (Rock) : CPU (Paper)`
Check both player's moves: 
If it's a tie (the computer and player pick the same move)
If there is a winner, print the winner, and the program ends.
